Sties usually heal in 5 to 7 days. To relieve the pain, apply warm compresses for 10 to 15 minutes, 4 times a day and take mild pain relievers. If the bump grows or doesn't go away, see your doctor.

Conjunctivitis is very contagious, so avoid contact with the eye and wash your hands often. Try over-the-counter eyedrops and apply warm compresses to relieve any discomfort.","No":{"Is your eye red, is your vision blurry and do you feel like you have sand in your eye?":{"Yes":"This sensation may be from a SCRATCHED CORNEA or from a small particle under the eyelid. Rinse your eye with clean water or a saline solution. If the sensation doesn't go away, see your doctor as soon as possible.","No":{"Do you have a burning sensation in the eye, is the eye red and itchy, and is the skin around the eye scaling?":{"Yes":"This chronic irritation is called BLEPHARITIS. Apply warm compresses and wash your eye gently with an eyewash and washcloth. If the problem doesn't resolve, see your doctor.","No":{"Do you wear contact lenses, and do you have eye pain?":{"Yes":"You may have an irritation from contact lens overuse or a more serious eye condition caused by your contact lenses. Remove your contact lenses and let your eyes rest for a while. If the redness or irritation doesn't go away, see your eye care professional.","No":"For more information, please talk to your doctor.
