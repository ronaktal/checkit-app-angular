A nosebleed can be scary to get - or see - but try to stay calm. Most nosebleeds look much worse than they really are. Almost all nosebleeds can be treated at home. If you get a nosebleed, sit down and lean slightly forward. Keeping your head above your heart will slow the bleeding. Lean forward so the blood will drain out of your nose instead of down the back of your throat. If you lean back, you may swallow the blood. This can irritate your stomach. Use your thumb and index finger to squeeze together the soft portion of your nose. This area is located between the end of your nose and the hard, bony ridge that forms the bridge of your nose. Keep holding your nose until the bleeding stops. Don't let go for at least 5 minutes. If it's still bleeding, hold it again for another 5 to 10 minutes. Once the bleeding stops, don't do anything that may make it start again, such as bending over or blowing your nose. See your doctor if: 1. The bleeding goes on for more than 20 minutes. 2.

In an emergency situation where regular water service has been interrupted - like a hurricane, flood, or water pipe breakage - local authorities may recommend using only bottled water, boiled water, or disinfected water until regular water service is restored. The instructions below show you how to boil and disinfect water to kill most disease-causing microorganisms that may be present in the water. However, boiling or disinfection will not destroy other contaminants, such as heavy metals, salts, and most other chemicals. ONLY USE WATER THAT HAS BEEN PROPERLY DISINFECTED FOR DRINKING, COOKING, MAKING ANY PREPARED DRINK, WASHING DISHES AND FOR BRUSHING TEETH. 1. Use bottled water that has not been exposed to flood waters if it is available. 2. If you don't have bottled water, you should boil water to make it safe. Boiling water will kill most types of disease-causing organisms that may be present. If water is cloudy, let it settle and filter it through a clean cloth, paperboiling water towel, or coffee filter. Bring water to a rolling boil for at least one minute. At altitudes above 5,000 feet (1,000 meters), boil water for three minutes.Let water cool naturally and store it in clean containers with covers. 3. if you can't boil water. Only use regular, unscented chlorine bleach products that are suitable for disinfection and sanitization as indicated on the label. The label may say that the active ingredient contains 6 or 8.25% of sodium hypochlorite. Do not use scented, color safe, or bleaches with added cleaners.If water is cloudy, let it settle and filter it through a clean cloth, paper towel, or coffee filter. Locate a clean dropper from your medicine cabinet or emergency supply kit. Locate a fresh liquid chlorine bleach or liquid chlorine bleach that is stored at room temperatures for less than one year. Use 8 drops of 6% bleach, or 6 drops of 8.25 percent bleach, to each gallon of water. Double the amount of bleach if the water is cloudy, colored, or very cold. Stir and let stand for 30 minutes. The water should have a slight chlorine odor. If it doesn't, repeat the dosage and let stand for another 15 minutes before use. 4.

Other sources of clean and safe water can be found inside and outside the home. DO NOT DRINK water that has an unusual odor or color, or that you suspect might be contaminated with fuel or toxic chemicals. This water cannot be made safe, so you must find a different source of water for your needs. The following are possible sources of water. Here are some sources of water from inside the home. Water from your home's water heater tank (part of your drinking water system, not your home heating system). Melted ice cubes made with water that was not contaminated. Water from your home's toilet tank (not from the bowl), if it is clear and has not been chemically treated with toilet cleaners such as those that change the color of the water. Liquid from canned fruit and vegetables Water from swimming pools and spas can be used for personal hygiene, cleaning, and related uses, but not for drinking.

HOW DO I KNOW IF MY CHILD IS DEHYDRATED? If your child is dehydrated, he or she may not urinate as often and the urine will be darker than usual. Your child may also be tired and not as active. HOW IS DEHYDRATION TREATED? You should give your child an oral rehydration solution, or ORS, to replace the lost fluids and electrolytes. Don't give your child clear liquids, like sodas, chicken broth, or juice, instead of an ORS. You can buy an ORS (one brand: Pedialyte) at the drugstore or supermarket and keep it at home in case your child becomes sick. Your child should breastfeed, bottle-feed, or eat normal foods after taking an ORS. Don't limit your child's foods to only the BRAT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast), and don't mix extra water into formula. HOW MUCH ORS SHOULD BE GIVEN? Using a syringe or spoon, you can give your child a small amount of the ORS every five minutes for three to four hours. Your doctor can help you decide the exact amount to give based on your child's weight. If your child continues to have diarrhea or vomiting, you may need to give him or her the ORS after each episode. When your child is no longer dehydrated, you can start a regular diet. If your child becomes dehydrated again, start the ORS treatment for another three to four hours. WHEN SHOULD I CALL THE DOCTOR? You should contact the doctor if your child is not better within 24 hours of starting ORS, or if you are having problems with the ORS (for example, it doesn't work, it is hard to give it to your child, or your child can't keep it down). Also contact your doctor if your child: 1. Has sunken eyes, less tears or saliva than usual, increased sleepiness, or irritability Has a fever (100.4 F or more in children three months or younger, 101 F or more in older children). 2. Has other medical problems or was born early. 3. Is younger than six months or weighs less than 18 pounds. 4. Has diarrhea with blood in it. CAN I PREVENT GASTROENTERITIS ? If it is caused by germs, it can be spread from one child to another. Clean surfaces that have been touched by a child who has been sick, and make sure your child washes his or her hands often. Your child should be vaccinated against certain viruses that can cause gastroenteritis, such as rotavirus.","No":"Presented below is information about a home-made Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS).

Press 'Yes' to skip this and  learn about how to deliver a baby. Press 'No' for general information on caring for yourself and baby after delivery. If a woman is giving birth, call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number immediately. Give the EMS call taker the following important information: The woman's name, age and expected due date. How long she has been having labor pains. Whether this is her first child.  Usually, in true labor, contractions get longer, stronger and closer together over time. They do not go away. If your contractions do not get stronger or closer together, or if the contractions stop when you rest or change position, you probably are not in labor. But if your contractions do not go away, call your caregiver. Also, you should call your doctor, midwife, birth center or hospital labor floor immediately, if: 1. You or your baby has special health needs, and your physician has told you to call as soon as contractions begin. 2. Your amniotic sac (bag of waters) breaks, even if you are not having contractions. This may be a sudden, large gush of fluid or a steady, small trickle of fluid that doesn't stop. 3. You have any vaginal bleeding. 4. You feel that your baby is not moving as much as she or he did before. 5. You have a fever or chills. 6. You have burning or pain when you urinate. 7. You have any signs of high blood pressure; headache; dizziness; spots before your eyes; or blurred vision. 8. You are sick to your stomach and unable to keep down 2 or more meals in a row. 9. You have severe or continuous abdominal pain. 10. You have contractions that happen every 10 minutes or more often, earlier than 3 weeks before your due date. 11. There is an increase in pelvic pressure or a vaginal discharge which suddenly increases in amount or becomes mucousy, watery or lightly bloody. 12. You have unexpected symptoms of any kind (e.g., numbness, tingling, slurred speech). View information about deliverying a baby ?":{"Yes":{"The following are general steps to take to deliver a baby. Press 'Yes' for a more detailed discussion. By following a few simple steps, you can effectively assist in the birth process while you wait for EMS personnel to arrive. If a woman is giving birth: 1. Talk with the woman to help her remain calm. 2. Place layers of clean sheets, towels or blankets under her and over her abdomen. 3. Control the scene so that the woman will have privacy. 4. Position the woman on her back with her knees bent, feet flat and legs spread wide apart. 5. Avoid contact with body fluids; wear disposable gloves and protective eye wear if possible. 6. Remember, the woman delivers the baby, so be patient and let it happen naturally. 7. The baby will be slippery; use a clean towel to receive and hold the baby; avoid dropping the baby. 8. Keep the baby warm; have a clean, warm towel or blanket handy to wrap the newborn. CAUTIONS: Do not let the woman get up or leave to find a bathroom (most women want to use the restroom). Do not hold the woman's knees together; this will not slow the birth process and may complicate the birth or harm the baby. Do not place your fingers in the vagina for any reason. Do not pull on the baby. Press 'Yes' for more information. ":{"Yes":{"The following is a more detailed section on deliverying a baby. Press 'No' to skip this and learn about major indications for C-section. Labor is divided into three stages: First Stage - the cervix dilates so that the baby can pass through. Your caregiver measures the opening of the cervix in centimeters. When the cervix is open to its fullest - 9 to 10 centimeters (about 4 inches) - it is large enough for the baby to pass through. Second Stage - by pushing (bearing down), you move the baby out through the birth canal, and the baby is born. Third Stage - your uterus continues to contract, and the placenta (afterbirth) is pushed out. Today, caregivers often encourage the mother to follow her own urges to bear down during birth. This can result in an easier birth for the mother and her baby. Discuss this with your caregiver since he or she may want to check to ensure that the cervix is dilated enough for pushing to be safe and effective. Pushing before the cervix is completely dilated can make it swell and tear and prolong labor. On the other hand, if you don't feel a strong urge to push when your cervix is fully dilated, try a change of position. Lying on your side may help. Your pushes will be more effective if you really feel that urge to bear down. Just as the head is coming out, your caregiver may tell you not to push for a minute. This allows time for the opening of your vagina to stretch, and to prevent tearing. If you have a strong urge to push, breathe deeply or pant. After the baby's head is out, your caregiver will check to see if the umbilical cord (the connection from the baby's navel to the placenta) is around the baby's neck. Generally, the fact that the cord is around the baby's neck is not a problem. However, if the cord is too tight, your caregiver will clamp and cut it immediately. While your caregiver is checking the cord, he or she will ask you not to bear down or push. Breathe deeply or pant through the contractions to keep from bearing down. With your next contraction, the baby's head may turn to the side. Now it is time to bear down because the baby's shoulders and body are ready to come out. Avoid holding your breath or bearing down too long or too hard. Let yourself make pushing noises. Push as your body tells you and try to ease the baby out. As you bear down, the shoulders and body will appear. Is it a boy or a girl? CONGRATULATIONS, MOM! HAPPY BIRTHDAY, BABY!":{"No":{"The following are major indications for C-section. Press 'Yes' to skip this and learn about monitoring and fetal distress. 1. You have had a previous cesarean delivery.  2. Your baby is very big or your pelvis is very small - or both. 3. Your labor does not progress effectively.  4. The baby develops 'fetal distress.' This can happen if the baby is not getting enough oxygen. One possible sign of fetal distress is a change in the baby's heart rate. Another possible sign is a 'meconium stain.' This happens when the baby has a bowel movement while in the uterus, causing the color of the fluid around the baby to change from clear to green, yellow or brown. If fetal distress is detected, work with your caregiver to increase the supply of oxygen to the baby. Your caregiver may also want to check the baby more closely by using continuous internal electronic monitoring or by examining a small drop blood from the baby's scalp (fetal blood sampling). These procedures may eliminate the need for a cesarean delivery. 5. The baby is coming out bottom-first. The usual position of a baby in the uterus is head-down. But some babies are in the bottom- or feet-first position, called a 'breech presentation.' Many breech babies turn head down by themselves. If your baby is in a breech position, talk with your caregiver about exercises you can do to help turn the baby, and about the best way to deliver. 6. There are problems with the placenta. Sometimes, the placenta separates from the uterus before the baby is born and can cause vaginal bleeding in late pregnancy (abruptio placenta), or the placenta is attached to the uterus over part or all of the cervix (placenta previa). Either of these conditions can cause severe bleeding for the mother and loss of oxygen for the baby, and result in a decision to deliver by cesarean. 7. The mother has severe Pregnancy Induced Hypertension (PIH). Pregnancy Induced Hypertension (PIH) is a serious illness that sometimes occurs during pregnancy, generally in the third trimester. Signs of PIH are sudden weight gain, severe swelling of feet and hands, severe headaches, dizziness, blurred vision, protein in the urine, and an increase in blood pressure. PIH is dangerous for both mother and baby. The mother could have convulsions, a stroke or kidney failure if the baby is not delivered quickly. PIH, by limiting the flow of blood to the uterus, reduces the blood flow to the baby. 8. The mother has diabetes. 9. The mother has active genital herpes or other infections. Herpes and other infections at the time of delivery can make the baby very ill or even cause death. 10. The umbilical cord slips into the vagina before the baby (prolapsed cord). This is dangerous because the pressure of the baby's head against the cord will reduce the flow of blood and oxygen to the baby. ":{"Yes":"The following is general information about fetal monitoring and fetal distress. A baby's heart rate is about two times faster than an adults - usually ranging from 120 to 160 beats per minute. During labor and delivery, your caregivers will frequently check the baby's heartbeat. They will check the heartbeat during and between contractions. Changes in the baby's heart rate can be a sign that the baby is having difficulty - called fetal distress - and needs special care. Another measure of the baby's well-being is the color of the amniotic fluid in or from the amniotic sac. This is the fluid that surrounds the baby in your uterus. The fluid should be clear to milky white. If the color is yellow, green or brown, it means that your baby has passed stool into the amniotic fluid. Caregivers call this 'meconium staining.' This staining is a sign that the baby may need special care. It is normal for a breech (bottom first) baby to have a bowel movement during labor. This is because the buttocks and abdomen are being squeezed through the vagina. It does not mean that the baby needs special care. Most of the time, fetal heart rate changes or meconium staining are followed by the birth of a normal baby. But if changes in the heart rate or meconium staining occur, your caregiver will provide special care. He or she will use special tests, such as electronic fetal heart rate monitoring, fetal blood sampling or others. Throughout labor and delivery, your baby will be carefully checked. The nurse or licensed midwife will monitor the baby's heartbeat with a fetal monitor or ultrasonic doppler, used to magnify the sound of the baby's heartbeat. ","No":"No other information.

Take your baby along for the walk! To help prevent Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), it is best to put your baby on his or her back to sleep. SIDS is the sudden and unexplained death of an infant, under one year of age, who seems perfectly healthy. Check with your doctor to make sure your baby can sleep on his or her back. Most babies can, but a few babies have health conditions that require them to sleep on their stomachs. Make sure your baby sleeps on a firm mattress or other firm surface. Don't use fluffy blankets or comforters under the baby. When your baby is very young, don't put stuffed toys or pillows in the crib with him or her. Don't allow anyone to smoke around your baby.

To care for an open wound to the abdomen, follow these steps: 1. Put on disposable gloves or use another barrier. 2. Carefully position the person on his or her back with the knees bent, if that position does not cause pain. 3. Do not apply direct pressure. 4. Do not push any protruding organs back into the open wound. 5. Remove clothing from around the wound. 6. Apply moist, sterile dressings loosely over the wound (clean, warm tap water can be used). 7. Cover dressings loosely with plastic wrap, if available . To care for a closed wound to the abdomen: 1. While keeping the injured area still, apply cold to the affected area to control pain and swelling. 2. Carefully position the person on his or her back with the knees bent, if that position does not cause pain. 3. Keep the person from getting chilled or overheated.":{"Yes":"The following is general information about abdominal injuries and when to call 9-1-1. Like a chest injury, an injury to the abdomen may be either open or closed. Injuries to the abdomen can be very painful. Even with a closed wound, the rupture of an organ can cause serious internal bleeding, resulting in shock. It is especially difficult to determine if a person has an internal abdominal injury if he or she is unconscious. Always suspect an abdominal injury in a person who has multiple injuries. WHAT TO LOOK FOR: Signals of serious abdominal injury include: 1. Severe pain. 2. Bruising. 3. External bleeding. 4. Nausea. 5. Vomiting (sometimes blood). 6. Weakness. 7. Thirst. 10. Pain, tenderness or a tight feeling in the abdomen. 11. Organs protruding from the abdomen. 12. Rigid abdominal muscles. 13. Other signals of shock.

While you are waiting for emergency medical services (EMS) personnel to arrive, the best care you can give is to minimize movement of the person's head, neck and spine. As long as the person is breathing normally, support the head and neck in the position found. Do this by placing your hands on both sides of the person's head in the position in which you found it. Support the person's head in that position until EMS personnel take over supporting the person's head. If the head is sharply turned to one side, do not move it. Support the head and neck in the position found. If a person with a suspected head, neck or spinal injury is wearing a helmet, do not remove it unless you are specifically trained to do so and it is necessary to assess or access the person's airway. Minimize movement using the same manual technique you would use if the person were not wearing headgear. The person may become confused, drowsy or unconscious. Breathing may stop. The person may be bleeding. If the person is unconscious, keep the airway open and check breathing. You should take steps to control severe bleeding and keep the person from getting chilled or overheated.","No":"The following is general information about concussions and when to call 9-1-1.

It can be difficult to judge when a wound requires stitches. One rule of thumb is that a health care provider will need to stitch a wound if the edges of skin do not fall together, the laceration involves the face or when any wound is over 1/2 inch long. Stitches speed the healing process, lessen the chances of infection and minimize scarring. They should be placed within the first few hours after the injury. The following major injuries often require stitches: 1. Bleeding from an artery or uncontrolled bleeding. 2. Wounds that show muscle or bone, involve joints, gape widely, or involve hands or feet. 3. Wounds from large or deeply embedded objects. 4. Wounds from human or animal bites. 5. Wounds that, if left un-stitched, could leave conspicuous scars, such as those on the face.","Yes":{"Press 'Yes' to learn about General care for fractures and limb injuries. The following is general information about splinting. Splinting is a method of immobilizing an injured part to minimize movement and prevent further injury and should be used only if you have to move or transport the person to seek medical attention and if it does not cause more pain. Splint an injury in the position in which you find it. For fractures, splint the joints above and below the site of the injury. For sprains or joint injuries, splint the bones above and below the site of the injury. If you are not sure if the injury is a fracture or a sprain, splint both the bones and joints above and below the point of injury. Splinting materials should be soft or padded for comfort. Check for circulation (feeling, warmth and color) before and after splinting to make sure that the splint is not too tight. There are many methods of splinting, including: 1. Anatomic splints. The person's body is the splint. For example, you can splint an arm to the chest or an injured leg to the uninjured leg. 2. Soft splints. Soft materials, such as a folded blanket, towel, pillow or folded triangular bandage, can be used for the splint. A sling is a specific kind of soft splint that uses a triangular bandage tied to support an injured arm, wrist or hand. 3. Rigid splints. Padded boards, folded magazines or newspapers, or padded metal strips that do not have any sharp edges can serve as splints. 4. The ground. An injured leg stretched out on the ground is supported by the ground.":{"Yes":"The following is general information about how to care for limb injuries. General care for injuries to muscles, bone and joints includes following the mnemonic R.I.C.E: 1. Rest - Do not move or straighten the injured area. 2. Immobilize - Stabilize the injured area in the position it was found. Splint the injured part only if the person must be moved or transported to receive medical care and it does not cause more pain (see Splinting an Injury). Minimizing movement can prevent further injury. 3. Cold - Fill a plastic bag with ice and water or wrap ice with a damp cloth and apply ice to the injured area for periods of about 20 minutes. Place a thin barrier between the ice and bare skin. If 20-minute icing cannot be tolerated, apply ice for periods of 10 minutes. If continued icing is needed, remove the pack for 20 minutes, and then replace it. Cold reduces internal bleeding, pain and swelling. Do not apply heat as there is no evidence that applying heat helps muscle, bone or joint injuries. 4. Elevate - Elevate the injured part only if it does not cause more pain. Elevating the injured part may help reduce swelling.","No":"No other data. Press 'Back' or 'Home' to start over."}}}}}}}},{"Starting instructions for choking. Press 'Yes' if this an adult.

Although it may be frightening to watch, you can easily help to care for a person having a seizure. Remember that he or she cannot control the seizure. Do not try to stop the seizure. General principles of managing a seizure are to prevent injury, protect the person's airway and make sure that the airway is open after the seizure has ended. Do not hold or restrain the person. Do not put anything in the person's mouth or between the teeth. People having seizures rarely bite their tongues or cheeks with enough force to cause significant bleeding; however, some blood may be present. Make sure that the environment is as safe as possible to prevent injury to the person who is having a seizure. Remove any nearby furniture or other objects that may injure the person. Give care to a person who has had a seizure the same way you would for an unconscious person. When the seizure is over, make sure that the person's airway is open. Usually, the person will begin to breathe normally. If there is fluid in the person's mouth, such as saliva, blood or vomit, roll him or her on one side so that the fluid drains from the mouth. If the child or infant has a febrile seizure, it is important to immediately cool the body by giving a sponge bath with lukewarm water. The person may be drowsy and disoriented or unresponsive for a period of time. Check to see if he or she was injured during the seizure. Be comforting and reassuring.

WHAT TO LOOK FOR: The signals of frostbite include lack of feeling in the affected area, swelling and skin that appears waxy, is cold to the touch or is discolored (flushed, white, yellow or blue). In more serious cases, blisters may form and the affected part may turn black and show signs of deep tissue damage. HYPOTHERMIA: In a hypothermic condition, the entire body cools because its ability to keep warm is failing. The person will die if not given the proper care. The air temperature does not have to be below freezing for people to develop hypothermia. This is especially true if the person is wet or if it is windy. Elderly people in poorly heated homes can develop hypothermia. The homeless, the ill and young children also are at risk. Certain conditions can more easily lead to hypothermia, including: 1. Ingestion of substances that interfere with the body's ability to regulate temperature (such as alcohol, other drugs and certain medications). 2. Any medical condition that impairs circulation, such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease. 3. Prolonged exposure to cold, wet and/or windy conditions or wet clothing. WHAT TO LOOK FOR: Signals of hypothermia include the following: 1. Shivering. 2. Numbness. 3. Glassy stare. 4. Indifference. 5. Loss of consciousness. Shivering that stops without rewarming is a sign that the person's condition is worsening. He or she needs immediate medical care. WHEN TO CALL 9-1-1: Call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number immediately for any case of hypothermia.

You often can tell when a person is having an asthma attack by the hoarse whistling sound made while exhaling. This sound, known as wheezing, occurs because air becomes trapped in the lungs. Coughing after exercise, crying or laughing are other signals that an asthma attack could begin. Signals of an asthma attack include: 1. Trouble breathing or shortness of breath. 2. Rapid, shallow breathing. 3. Sweating. 4. Tightness in the chest. 5. Inability to talk without stopping for a breath. 6. Feelings of fear or confusion. WHEN TO CALL 9-1-1: Call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number if the person's breathing trouble does not improve in a few minutes after using the quick-relief medication. WHAT TO DO UNTIL HELP ARRIVES: Remain calm. This will help the person to remain calm and ease breathing troubles. Help the person to sit comfortably. Loosen any tight clothing around the neck and abdomen. Assist the person with his or her prescribed quick-relief medication if requested and if permitted by state or local regulations.":{"Yes":"Presented below is information on how to assist with an asthma inhaler. ASSISTING WITH AN ASTHMA INHALER. TIP: Always obtain consent and wash your hands immediately after giving care. Read and follow all instructions printed on the inhaler prior to administering the medication to the person. IF THE PERSON HAS MEDICATION FOR ASTHMA, HELP HIM OR HER TAKE IT IF ASKED. 1. HELP PERSON SIT UP: Help the person sit up and rest in a position comfortable for breathing. 2. CHECK PRESCRIPTION: Ensure that the prescription is in the person's name and is prescribed for 'quick relief' or 'acute' attacks. Ensure that the expiration date has not passed. 3. SHAKE INHALER. 4. REMOVE MOUTHPIECE COVER: If an extension tube (spacer) is available, attach and use it. 5. INSTRUCT PERSON TO BREATHE OUT: Tell the person to breathe out as much as possible through the mouth. TIP: The person may use different techniques, such as holding the inhaler two-finger lengths away from the mouth. 6. ADMINISTER MEDICATION: Have the person place his or her lips tightly around the mouthpiece and take a long, slow breath. As the person breathes in slowly, administer the medication by quickly pressing down on the inhaler canister, or the person may self-administer the medication. The person should continue a full, deep breath. Tell the person to try to hold his or her breath for a count of 10. When using an extension tube (spacer) have the person take 5 to 6 deep breaths through the tube without holding his or her breath. 7. RECORD TIME OF ADMINISTRATION: Note the time of administration and any change in the person's condition. The medication may be repeated once after 1 to 2 minutes. 8. HAVE PERSON RINSE MOUTH: Have the person rinse his or her mouth out with water to reduce side effects. Stay with the person and monitor his or her condition and give CARE for any other conditions. 9. CARE FOR SHOCK: Care for shock. Keep the person from getting chilled or overheated.
