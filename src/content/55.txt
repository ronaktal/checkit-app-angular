Position the infant face-up on your forearm. Place one hand and forearm on the child's back, cradling the back of the head, and one hand and forearm on the front of the infant. Use your thumb and fingers to hold the infant's jaw while sandwiching the infant between your forearms. 2. Turn the infant over so that he or she is face-down along your forearm. Lower your arm onto your thigh so that the infant's head is lower than his or her chest.  Then give 5 firm back blows with the heel of your hand between the shoulder blades. Each back blow should be a separate and distinct attempt to dislodge the object. Maintain support of the infant's head and neck by firmly holding the jaw between your thumb and forefinger.
