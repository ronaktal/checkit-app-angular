{"Presented is general information on caring for drowning victims. For an adult, give 2 rescue breaths as you would for a child or an infant once you determine there is no breathing. If alone, you should give 2 minutes of care before calling 9-1-1 (Care First) for an unconscious person who has been submerged. Do not enter the water unless you are specifically trained to perform in-water rescues. Get help from a trained responder, such as a lifeguard, to get the person out of the water as quickly and safely as possible. If the person is not breathing, you will have to give proper care.":{"Yes":"Presented is general information on caring for drowning victims.
