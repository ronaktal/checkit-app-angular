{"Presented below is general information about fainting and how to care for someone who may be fainting. A person who is about to faint often becomes pale, begins to sweat and then loses consciousness and collapses. A person who feels weak or dizzy may prevent a fainting spell by lying down or sitting with his or her head level with the knees. WHEN TO CALL 9-1-1: Call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number when in doubt about the condition of a person who has fainted. It is always appropriate to seek medical care for fainting. WHAT TO DO UNTIL HELP ARRIVES: Lower the person to the ground or other flat surface and position him or her on his or her back, lying flat. Loosen any tight clothing, such as a tie or collar. Check that the person is breathing. Do not give the person anything to eat or drink. If the person vomits, roll him or her onto one side. ":{"Yes":"No other data.
