{"Does your child have frequent, watery bowel movements?":{"Yes":"DIARRHEA is often caused by a gastrointestinal infection, but it can also be caused by other illnesses or something your child eats. Diarrhea can be harmful to children if it leads to dehydration. Encourage your older child (older than 2) to drink water and other clear fluids. Ask your doctor about giving your baby or toddler an oral rehydration solution (ORS). Avoid giving your baby too much fruit juice, as this may cause diarrhea.","No":{"Does your child strain to have a bowel movement, and are his or her stools very hard and dry?":{"Yes":"Hard, pellet-like stools may be a sign of CONSTIPATION. If your infant or child has ongoing constipation and very infrequent bowel movements, it may be a sign of HIRSCHSPRUNG'S DISEASE, a condition that affects the wall of the large intestine.","No":{"Does your child have gas, bloating and diarrhea, especially right after eating foods that contain wheat or cow's milk?":{"Yes":"The inability to digest wheat (CELIAC DISEASE) or milk (LACTOSE INTOLERANCE) can cause these symptoms. Eliminate foods that make your child sick from his or her diet. Talk to your doctor about treating your child's intolerance of milk and dairy products with lactose enzyme. Soy formula may be an appropriate substitute for infants who have lactose intolerance.","No":{"Does your child seem to have pain with bowel movements, or do you suspect he or she holds the bowel movements to prevent pain?":{"Yes":"Pain from HEMORRHOIDS or an ANAL FISSURE can cause a child to hold a bowel movement for many days. See your doctor if the pain is not better in a few days.","No":"For more information, please talk to your doctor. If you think your child's problem is serious, call your doctor right away. "}}}}}}}}
